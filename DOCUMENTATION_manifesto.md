# Documentation Manifesto

## Philosophy

Documentation is a first-class citizen in Shatterforge. It should empower users, contributors, and maintainers to understand, use, and extend the platform efficiently.

## Principles

- **Clarity:** Write clear, concise, and accessible documentation.
- **Completeness:** Cover all features, APIs, and workflows.
- **Up-to-date:** Keep documentation synchronized with code changes.
- **Community:** Encourage contributions and feedback on docs.
- **Best Practices:** Follow industry standards for structure and style.

## Structure

- `README.md`: Project overview and setup
- `FEATURES.md`: List of features
- `QUICK_START.md`: Fast setup guide
- API Reference: Detailed code documentation
- Tutorials: Step-by-step guides for common tasks

## Contribution

- All documentation changes should be reviewed
- Use clear commit messages for doc updates
- Welcome suggestions and improvements from the community
